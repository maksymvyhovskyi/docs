## 1. Introduction

The Data Hub API enables you to explore and discover data sources in Mendix Data Hub and use them to build new apps. You can also set up a registration flow in your deployment pipeline to register new data sources from your applications to the Data Hub Catalog.

To use the Mendix Data Hub a license is required.

## 2. The Data Hub API

The [DataHubAPI](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) is an Open API (formerly Swagger) specification which contains all the APIs for the operations that are currently available which include the following: 

* Registration
* Search

You can access the API at: http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
For the current release, the interactive features of the OpenAPI interface are not operational and therefore the **Try it out** feature does not work.
{{% /alert %}}

To access the API, authorization is required. Mendix users must obtain a Personal Access Token (PAT) as described in [Generating your Personal Access Token](#generatepat).

For every request that is made to the Data Hub API, you must add a header called `MxToken` and include the PAT in order to access your organization's Data Hub. 

For example:
```
curl -X GET "https://hub.mendix.com/rest/datahubservice/v2/data?contractType=OData_3_0" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "MxToken: 4XsnkDhNWu1drAugLYTMLstRGa8F9qeTD5DJU2GgERwhpyTZCbJoLWbKy1BYbSUgENr5Gb43cLwXU6Mj3gbB2nwEd5rf6eRfcuLq"
```

## 3. Generating your Personal Access Token {#generatepat}

Mendix users (with a registered account) can obtain the necessary PAT using the Mendix **Warden** app by following these steps: 

1. You can access the **Warden** app at: https://warden.mendix.com/.

2. When you are prompted, sign-in using your username and password. The Warden Home page is shown:

	![Warden Home Screen](attachments/dta-hub-apis/warden-home-screen.png)

3. To create a new personal access token, click **Add** to go to the **Create a Personal Access Token** screen. 

4. Enter a **Name** for the token. This name will be used when generated tokens are listed on the Warden home screenâ€”that also identifies which tokens are being used.

5. For the **Select scopes that can be used with this token:** under Data Hub, check both the **mx:datahub:services:read** and **mx:datahub:services:write**:

	![create token home](attachments/dta-hub-apis/create-pat-token.png)

6. Click **Create**. The token will be generated and displayed in a pop-up window:

	![generated token](attachments/dta-hub-apis/generated-pat-token.png)

7. Copy the **Token secret** to your clipboard by clicking the storage icon below the secret. 

	{{% alert type="info" %}}Make sure that you keep this token in a secure place. You will not get another chance to view this token once you **Close** this dialog box.
  {{% /alert %}}

	{{% alert type="info" %}}You must include this token in an authorization header called `MxToken` for every request to the Data Hub API.
  {{% /alert %}}

8. Click **Close** to return to the **Personal Access Tokens** home screen. Your generated token will be listed:

	![token list](attachments/dta-hub-apis/token-list.png)

9. For each token, **Last Used:** will show when the token was last used. 

10. You can delete unused tokens by clicking the "bin" icon for the token.
